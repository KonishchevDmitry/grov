Grov - Google Reader offline viewer

This program is intended to introduce a facility to read, star and share your
Google Reader items when you are in offline or have a very slow and
inconsistent connection (transport, etc).

I recently started the development and it has not yet most of features, but it
is already usable. Also, I am writing this program in order to learn the Qt
library, so I will write it slowly and exclusively just for fun. :)
