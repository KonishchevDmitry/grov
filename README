grov - Google Reader offline viewer

This program is intended to introduce a facility to read, star and share your
Google Reader items when you are in offline or have very slow connection
(transport, etc).

I recently started the development and it has not yet even base features to
work with it. Also, I am writing this program in order to learn the Qt library,
so I will write it slowly and exclusively just for fun. :)
