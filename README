Grov - Google Reader offline viewer

Grov gives you a facility to read, star and share your Google Reader items when
you are offline or have a very slow and inconsistent connection (transport, etc).

Features:
* Downloading images from items' summaries.
* Full downloading of pages to which items refers.
* Single file data storage which makes very convenient its coping from one PC
  to another.

I recently started the development and it has not yet most of features, but it
is already usable. Also, I am writing this program in order to learn the Qt
library, so I will write it slowly and exclusively just for fun. :)
